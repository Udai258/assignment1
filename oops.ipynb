        "1)What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "Ans:)Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects. Here are five key points:\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation – Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (class).\n",
        "Abstraction – Hiding implementation details and exposing only the necessary functionalities.\n",
        "Inheritance – Allowing a class to derive properties and behaviors from another class, promoting code reuse.\n",
        "Polymorphism – Enabling a single function or method to operate in different ways based on the object.\n",
        "Modularity & Reusability – Structuring code into self-contained objects, making it more manageable and reusable.\n",
        "\n",
        "2)What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "Ans)A class in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, brand, model):\n",
        "        self.brand = brand  # Attribute\n",
        "        self.model = model  # Attribute\n",
        "\n",
        "    def display_info(self):  # Method\n",
        "        print(f\"Car: {self.brand} {self.model}\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Creating an object (instance) of the class\n",
        "my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\")\n",
        "my_car.display_info()  # Output: Car: Toyota Corolla\n",
        "Here, Car is a class, and my_car is an object (instance) of that class.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "Ans:)An object in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with attributes (data) and methods (functions) that define its behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, brand, model):\n",
        "        self.brand = brand  # Attribute\n",
        "        self.model = model  # Attribute\n",
        "\n",
        "    def display_info(self):  # Method\n",
        "        print(f\"Car: {self.brand} {self.model}\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Creating objects (instances) of the class\n",
        "car1 = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\")\n",
        "car2 = Car(\"Honda\", \"Civic\")\n",

        "car1.display_info()  # Output: Car: Toyota Corolla\n",
        "car2.display_info()  # Output: Car: Honda Civic\n",
        "Key Points:\n",
        "Objects are created from a class.\n",
        "Each object has unique attribute values but follows the same structure.\n",
        "Objects interact with each other and the program using methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4) What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "Ans:)Feature\tAbstraction\tEncapsulation\n",
        "Definition\tHiding implementation details and showing only essential features.\tWrapping data and methods together to protect them from outside interference.\n",
        "Purpose\tFocuses on hiding complexity from the user.\tFocuses on data protection and restricting direct access.\n",
        "Implementation\tAchieved using abstract classes and interfaces.\tAchieved using access modifiers (public, private, protected).\n",
        "Example\tA car's steering wheel hides the complex mechanics of turning.\tA car’s engine is encapsulated within the body, preventing direct access.\n",
        "OOP Benefit\tImproves usability by simplifying interaction.\tEnhances security by restricting unauthorized acess.\n",
        "5)What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "Ans)Dunder Methods (Magic Methods): Special methods in Python that start and end with double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__).\n",
        "\n",
        "Object Initialization: __init__ is used to initialize objects, while __new__ is responsible for instance creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Operator Overloading: Methods like __add__, __sub__, and __mul__ allow custom behavior for +, -, and * operators.\n",
        "\n",
        "Built-in Function Integration: Methods like __len__, __getitem__, and __call__ allow objects to work with len(), indexing (obj[key]), and calling (obj()).\n",
        "\n",
        "String Representation & Comparison: __str__ provides a user-friendly string representation, while __eq__, __lt__, and others define object comparisons.\n",
        "\n",
        "6) Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "Ans) Definition: Inheritance is an OOP concept where a class (child/derived class) derives properties and behaviors from another class (parent/base class), promoting code reusability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Types of Inheritance: Python supports single, multiple, multilevel, hierarchical, and hybrid inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "super() Function: The super() function is used to call methods from the parent class inside the child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Method Overriding: A child class can redefine (override) a parent class method to provide a specific implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation & Reusability: Inheritance helps in organizing and structuring code efficiently while avoiding code duplication.\n",
        "\n",
        "7)What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "Ans)Definition: Polymorphism in OOP allows a single interface to be used for different data types, enabling one function or method to work with multiple object types.\n",
        "\n",
        "Method Overriding: A child class redefines a method from its parent class to provide specific behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Operator Overloading: Special methods (like __add__) allow operators to work differently based on object types.\n",
        "\n",
        "Duck Typing: In Python, if an object has the required method, it can be used regardless of its class (\"If it quacks like a duck, it’s a duck\").\n",
        "\n",
        "Code Reusability & Flexibility: Polymorphism enhances modularity, making programs easier to extend and maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "8) How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "Ans)Definition: Encapsulation is the practice of restricting direct access to an object's data and modifying it only through methods, ensuring data security.\n",
        "\n",
        "Access Modifiers: Python uses three types of access specifiers:\n",
        "\n",
        "Public (var) → Accessible anywhere.\n",
        "Protected (_var) → Intended for internal use but accessible.\n",
        "Private (__var) → Name-mangled to prevent direct access.\n",
        "Getter & Setter Methods: Used to access and modify private attributes safely.\n",
        "\n",

        "print(p._Person__name)  # Accessing private attribute (not recommended)\n",
        "Benefits: Encapsulation ensures data hiding, prevents unauthorized modification, and enhances code maintainability.\n",
        "9)What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "Ans)Definition: A constructor is a special method (__init__) in Python that is automatically called when an object of a class is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: It initializes the object’s attributes and sets up its initial state.\n",
        "\n",
        "Syntax: Defined using def __init__(self, parameters), where self refers to the instance of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",
        "        self.age = age\n",
        "Types of Constructors:\n",
        "\n",
        "Default Constructor: No parameters except self.\n",
        "Parameterized Constructor: Takes arguments to initialize attributes.\n",
        "Automatic Execution: The constructor runs automatically when an object is created, without needing an explicit call.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "p = Person(\"Alice\", 25)  # Constructor is called automatically\n",
        "print(p.name, p.age)  # Output: Alice 25\n",
        "10) What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "Ans)Class Method (@classmethod): A method that operates on the class level rather than instance level. It uses cls as the first parameter and can modify class attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Static Method (@staticmethod): A method that belongs to the class but does not operate on class or instance attributes. It behaves like a regular function inside a class.\n",

        "10) What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "Ans:)Here are the key differences between class methods and static methods in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "Class Method (@classmethod)\n",
        "\n",
        "Defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "Takes cls as the first parameter, referring to the class.\n",
        "Can modify class-level attributes.\n",

        "class MathUtils:\n",
        "    @staticmethod\n",
        "    def add(a, b):\n",
        "        return a + b\n",
        "\n",
        "print(MathUtils.add(5, 3))  # Output: 8\n",
        "Key Difference:\n",
        "\n",
        "Class methods can modify class state (use cls).\n",
        "Static methods cannot modify class or instance state.\n",
        "Use Case for Class Methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "When you need to modify class attributes or create instances.\n",
        "Example: Alternative constructors (from_dict() method).\n",
        "Use Case for Static Methods:\n",

        "When a method is logically related to the class but does not need class or instance data (e.g., utility functions).\n",
        "\n",
        "11) What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "Ans:)Method overloading in Python refers to the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. However, Python does not support traditional method overloading like other languages (e.g., Java or C++). Instead, it can be achieved using:\n",
        "\n",
        "Default Arguments – Methods can take default parameter values to handle different cases.\n",
        "Variable-Length Arguments (*args and **kwargs) – Methods can accept a flexible number of arguments.\n",
        "Manual Overloading – Using conditional logic inside a method to handle different argument types and counts.\n",
        "Since Python allows only the latest defined method with the same name, explicit overloading must be handled within the function.\n",
        "12) What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "Ans:)Method overriding in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) refers to redefining a method in a subclass that is already defined in its parent class. Here are five key points:\n",
        "\n",
        "Same Method Name & Signature – The overridden method in the subclass must have the same name and parameters as in the parent class.\n",
        "Inheritance-Based – Overriding occurs when a subclass inherits from a parent class and provides a new implementation for an existing method.\n",
        "Runtime Polymorphism – It enables dynamic method dispatch, allowing calls to subclass methods via a parent reference.\n",
        "super() Keyword – The super() function can be used to call the parent class method inside the overridden method.\n",
        "Customization – Allows modifying or extending the behavior of a parent class method without altering its structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "13) What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "Ans:)A property decorator in Python is used to define getter, setter, and deleter methods for class attributes in an elegant way. Here are five key points:\n",
        "\n",
        "@property Decorator – Converts a method into a getter, allowing access to a private attribute as if it were a property.\n",
        "@<property_name>.setter – Defines a setter method to modify the property while enforcing validation or constraints.\n",
        "@<property_name>.deleter – Allows defining a deleter method to delete the property.\n",
        "Encapsulation – Provides controlled access to private attributes while maintaining an intuitive syntax.\n",
        "Example Usage – Helps create read-only properties or properties with controlled modification behavior.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name):\n",

        "        if isinstance(new_name, str):\n",
        "            self._name = new_name  # Setter\n",
        "        else:\n",
        "            raise ValueError(\"Name must be a string\")\n",

        "14) Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "Ans:)Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that enhances flexibility and maintainability. Here are five key reasons why polymorphism is important:\n",
        "\n",
        "Code Reusability – Allows the same interface to be used for different data types, reducing redundancy and improving modularity.\n",
        "Flexibility & Scalability – Enables writing more generic and scalable code that can handle different object types dynamically.\n",
        "Simplifies Code Maintenance – Reduces the need for multiple conditional statements by allowing objects to be treated uniformly.\n",
        "Supports Method Overriding & Overloading – Facilitates dynamic method dispatch, enabling customized behavior in subclasses.\n",
        "Enhances Readability & Efficiency – Promotes clean, understandable, and efficient code by adhering to the Open/Closed Principle, allowing easy extension without modifying existing code.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        pass\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "15) What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "Ans:)An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated and serves as a blueprint for subclasses. Here are three key points:\n",
        "\n",
        "Defined Using ABC Module – Abstract classes are created using the ABC (Abstract Base Class) module and must have at least one abstract method.\n",
        "Abstract Methods – These methods are declared but not implemented in the abstract class, forcing subclasses to provide an implementation.\n",
        "Encourages Code Structure – Ensures that all subclasses follow a consistent interface, promoting better design and maintainability.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
        "\n",

        "16) What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "Ans:)Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers several advantages that improve code organization, maintainability, and scalability. Here are five key benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation – Bundles data and methods together, restricting direct access to data and ensuring better security and modularity.\n",
        "Reusability (Inheritance) – Allows code reuse through inheritance, reducing redundancy and improving efficiency.\n",
        "Polymorphism – Enables flexible and dynamic method behavior, allowing a single interface to work with different data types.\n",
        "Abstraction – Hides complex implementation details from the user, simplifying code interaction and reducing complexity.\n",
        "Scalability & Maintainability – Promotes structured and organized code, making it easier to scale, debug, and maintain over time.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "class Vehicle:\n",
        "    def move(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Vehicle is moving\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Car(Vehicle):  # Inherits from Vehicle\n",
        "    def move(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Car is driving\")\n",
        "\n",
        "obj = Car()\n",
        "obj.move()  # Output: Car is driving (Polymorphism & Inheritance)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "17) What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "Ans:)The main differences between class variables and instance variables in Python are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition & Scope:\n",
        "\n",
        "Class Variable: Shared across all instances of a class and defined outside any method using the class name.\n",
        "Instance Variable: Unique to each instance and defined inside a method using self.\n",
        "Memory Allocation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Class Variable: Stored in a shared memory location for all objects of the class.\n",
        "Instance Variable: Stored separately for each instance.\n",
        "Access & Modification:\n",
        "\n",
        "Class Variable: Can be accessed using ClassName.variable_name or self.variable_name. Changes affect all instances if modified at the class level.\n",
        "Instance Variable: Accessed and modified using self.variable_name. Changes affect only that specific instance.\n",
        "Usage:\n",
        "\n",
        "Class Variable: Used for constants or shared properties (e.g., keeping track of object count).\n",
        "Instance Variable: Stores unique object-specific data.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    wheels = 4  # Class variable (shared)\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __init__(self, color):\n",
        "        self.color = color  # Instance variable (unique per object)\n",
        "\n",
        "car1 = Car(\"Red\")\n",
        "car2 = Car(\"Blue\")\n",
        "\n",
        "print(car1.wheels, car1.color)  # Output: 4, Red\n",
        "print(car2.wheels, car2.color)  # Output: 4, Blue\n",
        "\n",
        "Car.wheels = 6  # Modifying class variable affects all instances\n",
        "print(car1.wheels, car2.wheels)  # Output: 6, 6\n",
        "\n",
        "18) What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "Ans:)Multiple inheritance in Python allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class. Here are five key points:\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition – A subclass can inherit attributes and methods from multiple parent classes, combining their functionality.\n",
        "Syntax – Defined by specifying multiple parent classes in parentheses during subclass declaration.\n",
        "Method Resolution Order (MRO) – Python follows the C3 Linearization (MRO) to determine the order in which methods are inherited, using the super() function.\n",
        "Code Reusability – Allows a subclass to reuse code from multiple base classes, reducing redundancy.\n",
        "Potential Complexity – Can lead to conflicts if different parent classes have methods with the same name, requiring careful MRO handling.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "class A:\n",
        "    def show(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Class A\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class B:\n",
        "    def display(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Class B\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class C(A, B):  # Multiple Inheritance\n",
        "    pass\n",
        "\n",
        "obj = C()\n",
        "obj.show()    # Output: Class A\n",
        "obj.display() # Output: Class B\n",
        "Here, C inherits methods from both A and B.\n",
        "\n",
        "19)Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        "Ans:)The __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python are used for string representation of objects. Here are five key points:\n",
        "\n",
        "__str__ (User-Friendly Representation)\n",
        "\n",
        "Returns a readable and well-formatted string for end-users.\n",
        "Called by print() and str() functions.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy\n",
        "Edit\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    def __str__(self):\n",
        "        return \"This is a Car\"\n",
        "\n",
        "print(str(Car()))  # Output: This is a Car\n",
        "__repr__ (Official Representation)\n",
        "\n",
        "Returns a precise, developer-friendly string representation.\n",
        "Should ideally return a valid Python expression that can recreate the object.\n",
        "Called by repr() or in interactive mode.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy\n",
        "Edit\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    def __repr__(self):\n",
        "        return \"Car()\"\n",
        "\n",
        "print(repr(Car()))  # Output: Car()\n",
        "Key Difference\n",
        "\n",
        "__str__ is for human-readable output.\n",
        "__repr__ is for debugging and object reconstruction.\n",
        "Fallback Behavior\n",
        "\n",
        "If __str__ is not defined, __repr__ is used as a fallback.\n",
        "If neither is defined, Python defaults to <__main__.ClassName object at memory_address>.\n",
        "Example with Both Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "class Car:\n",

        "\n",
        "    def __repr__(self):\n",
        "        return f\"Car('{self.model}')\"  # Debugging\n",
        "\n",
        "my_car = Car(\"Tesla\")\n",
        "print(str(my_car))  # Output: Car Model: Tesla\n",
        "print(repr(my_car)) # Output: Car('Tesla')\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "20) What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "Ans:)The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent class. Here are five key points about its significance:\n",
        "\n",
        "Access Parent Class Methods – Allows a subclass to call a method from its parent class without explicitly naming it.\n",
        "Supports Multiple Inheritance – Helps resolve Method Resolution Order (MRO) issues when dealing with multiple parent classes.\n",
        "Avoids Redundant Code – Prevents code duplication by reusing parent class methods in a structured way.\n",
        "Works with __init__ Constructor – Commonly used to initialize parent class attributes in the subclass.\n",
        "Ensures Proper MRO Execution – Follows Python’s C3 Linearization (MRO) to determine the correct method to execute.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "class Parent:\n",
        "    def show(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Parent method\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Child(Parent):\n",
        "    def show(self):\n",
        "        super().show()  # Calls Parent's show() method\n",
        "        print(\"Child method\")\n",
        "\n",
        "c = Child()\n",
        "c.show()\n",
        "Output:\n",
        "\n",
        "sql\n",
        "\n",
        "Parent method  \n",
        "Child method  \n",
        "Here, super().show() ensures that the Parent's method is executed before the Child's method.\n",
        "\n",
        "21) What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "Ans:)The __del__ method in Python is a special method called a destructor. It is executed when an object is about to be destroyed. Here are four key points about its significance:\n",
        "\n",
        "Automatic Cleanup – It is called when an object is deleted or goes out of scope, helping free up resources like files or network connections.\n",
        "Garbage Collection – Python's garbage collector automatically calls __del__ when an object has no references left.\n",
        "Custom Cleanup Logic – Allows defining custom actions (e.g., closing files, releasing memory) before an object is destroyed.\n",
        "Use with Caution – Overriding __del__ can lead to issues like circular references, which may prevent garbage collection.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "class FileHandler:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, filename):\n",
        "        self.file = open(filename, 'w')\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __del__(self):\n",
        "        self.file.close()\n",
        "        print(\"File closed successfully\")\n",
        "\n",
        "handler = FileHandler(\"test.txt\")\n",
        "del handler  # Calls __del__, closing the file\n",
        "Output:\n",
        "\n",
        "arduino\n",
        "\n",
        "File closed successfully\n",
        "Here, __del__ ensures the file is closed when the object is deleted.\n",
        "\n",
        "22) What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        " Ans:)The @staticmethod and @classmethod decorators in Python modify method behavior in a class. Here are five key differences:\n",
        "\n",
        "Method Binding:\n",
        "\n",
        "@staticmethod is independent of class and instance; it does not receive self or cls as the first parameter.\n",
        "@classmethod is bound to the class and takes cls as its first parameter, allowing access to class variables and methods.\n",
        "Access to Class Attributes:\n",
        "\n",
        "@staticmethod cannot modify or access class-level attributes.\n",
        "@classmethod can modify class-level attributes since it receives cls.\n",
        "Use Case:\n",
        "\n",
        "@staticmethod is used for utility functions that do not need access to class data.\n",
        "@classmethod is used when class-level modifications are needed.\n",
        "Inheritance Behavior:\n",
        "\n",
        "@staticmethod does not depend on class inheritance.\n",
        "@classmethod follows the Method Resolution Order (MRO) and adapts to subclass behavior.\n",
        "Example Usage:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "\n",
        "class MyClass:\n",
        "    class_variable = \"Class Level Data\"\n",
        "\n",
        "    @staticmethod\n",
        "    def static_method():\n",
        "        print(\"I do not access class or instance data\")\n",
        "\n",
        "    @classmethod\n",
        "    def class_method(cls):\n",
        "        print(f\"I can access: {cls.class_variable}\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Calling methods\n",
        "MyClass.static_method()   # Output: I do not access class or instance data\n",
        "MyClass.class_method()    # Output: I can access: Class Level Data\n",
        "Here, static_method() is independent, while class_method() can access the class variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "23) How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "Ans:)Polymorphism in Python works with inheritance by allowing a subclass to provide a different implementation of a method defined in the parent class. Here are five key points:\n",
        "\n",
        "Method Overriding – A subclass can override a parent class method to provide a specific implementation while keeping the same method name.\n",
        "Dynamic Method Resolution – Python determines which method to call at runtime based on the object's actual type, enabling runtime polymorphism.\n",
        "Code Reusability – Allows using a common interface for different subclasses, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.\n",
        "Works with Functions & Collections – Parent class methods can be used interchangeably with subclass objects in loops, lists, or functions.\n",
        "Example Implementation – Demonstrates how different subclasses override a method from the parent class.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "python\n",
        "\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        return \"Animal speaks\"\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        return \"Bark\"\n",
        "\n",
        "class Cat(Animal):\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        return \"Meow\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# Polymorphic behavior\n",
        "animals = [Dog(), Cat(), Animal()]\n",
        "for animal in animals:\n",
        "    print(animal.speak())  # Calls the overridden method dynamically\n",
        "Output:\n",
        "\n",
        "nginx\n",
        "\n",
        "Bark  \n",
        "Meow  \n",
        "Animal speaks  \n",
        "Here, method overriding enables polymorphism, allowing different subclasses to implement their own versions of speak(), while maintaining a common interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "24)What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "Ans:)Method chaining in Python OOP allows calling multiple methods on the same object in a single statement. Here are five key points:\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition – It enables calling multiple methods sequentially on the same object by returning self from each method.\n",
        "Improves Readability – Reduces the need for multiple statements, making the code more concise and elegant.\n",
        "Requires return self – Each method must return self to allow further chaining.\n",
        "Common in Fluent Interfaces – Used in frameworks like pandas, Django ORM, and libraries that implement a fluent API.\n",
        "Example Implementation – Demonstrates how method chaining works in practice.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "class Car:\n",

        "\n",
        "25) What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:)The __call__ method in Python allows an instance of a class to be called as if it were a function. Here are five key points about its purpose:\n",
        "\n",
        "Makes Objects Callable – Enables an instance of a class to be used like a function by defining __call__.\n",
        "Encapsulation of Logic – Allows storing state within an object while executing logic when called.\n",
        "Useful in Function Wrapping – Commonly used in decorators, caching mechanisms, and factories.\n",
